Make an extremely smooth Hygroscopic coating out of nanomaterials that will cause Steam and water molecules to adhere to the discs creating very thin but highly efficient boundary layers with zero slip at the surface! This is a simple but practical step for higher mechanical energy extraction and thermodynamic efficiency.

Inspired by cotton, cellulose, and starch's ability to pull moisture out of the air but dry out (release water) from only ambient thermal energy.
